## Project Installation and Setup Guide

This comprehensive guide is designed to assist you in setting up and running the Python scripts `stock.py` and `sales.py` included in this project. Follow the instructions provided below to ensure a seamless setup and execution process.

## Prerequisites

Ensure Python is installed on your computer before proceeding. If not, visit [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install the Python environment.

## Downloading the Project

1. Go to the project's GitHub page.
2. Find and click the **Code** button, then choose **Download ZIP**.
3. After downloading, extract the ZIP file to your preferred location.

## Preparing the Files

The correct execution of `stock.py` and `sales.py` requires specific files to be placed in designated paths:

For `stock.py`:
- Daily stock CSV: `C:\Users\erixy\OneDrive\Work\_Estoques\LOJA\22.02.2024.csv`
- Current stock Excel: `C:\Users\erixy\OneDrive\Work\_Estoques\LOJA\_ESTOQUE_ATUAL_LOJA.xlsx`
- Consolidated stock Excel: `C:\Users\erixy\OneDrive\Work\_Estoques\ESTOQUE GERAL.xlsx`

For `sales.py`:
- Current sales CSV: `C:\Users\erixy\OneDrive\Work\_Estoques\atual.csv`
- Previous sales CSV: `C:\Users\erixy\OneDrive\Work\_Estoques\anterior.csv`
- Sales report Excel: `C:\Users\erixy\OneDrive\Work\_Relat√≥rios\VENDAS.xlsx`

Ensure these files are in the specified locations. If not, relocate them accordingly before proceeding.

## Running the Scripts

To run either script, follow these general steps, adjusting as necessary for the specific script (`stock.py` or `sales.py`):

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script you wish to execute. Note that this directory is distinct from where your data files are stored unless you've intentionally placed the script there.

```
cd path/to/script_folder
```
3. Execute the script by typing the following command and hitting Enter:
- For `stock.py`:
  ```
  python stock.py
  ```
- For `sales.py`:
  ```
  python sales.py
  ```

If set up correctly, the script will run and carry out its tasks using the files from their designated locations. In case of issues, ensure all files are correctly placed as per the instructions and that Python is properly installed on your system.
