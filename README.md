## Project Installation and Setup Guide

This guide will help you get started with running the `script.py` Python script included in the project. Please follow the instructions below carefully to ensure everything works smoothly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If you do not have Python installed, please visit [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install it.

## Downloading the Project

1. Navigate to the GitHub page for this project.
2. Locate the **Code** button and click it. Then, select **Download ZIP**.
3. Once the download is complete, extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.

## Preparing the Files

To ensure the script.py runs correctly, it is crucial to have the required files located in specific paths on your system. Here are the files you need, along with their respective paths:

- The daily stock CSV file should be located at `C:\Users\erixy\OneDrive\Work\_Estoques\LOJA\22.02.2024.csv`.
- The current stock Excel file should be located at `C:\Users\erixy\OneDrive\Work\_Estoques\LOJA\_ESTOQUE_ATUAL_LOJA.xlsx`.
- The consolidated stock Excel file should be located at `C:\Users\erixy\OneDrive\Work\_Estoques\ESTOQUE GERAL.xlsx`.

Please ensure these files are located in the specified paths. If they are not, you will need to move them to the correct locations before running the script.

## Running the Script

Once you have all the required files in the right place, you're ready to run the script. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where `script.py` is located. This will not be the same as where your data files are stored, unless you've specifically placed `script.py` in one of those directories.
```
cd path/to/folder
```
3. Run the script by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
```
python script.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, the script will execute and perform its intended tasks by accessing the files from their specified locations. Should you encounter any issues, please ensure all files are placed correctly according to the paths given above, and verify that Python is properly installed on your computer.
