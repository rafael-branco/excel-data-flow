## Project Installation and Setup Guide

This guide will help you get started with running the `script.py` Python script included in the project. Please follow the instructions below carefully to ensure everything works smoothly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. If you do not have Python installed, please visit [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install it.

## Downloading the Project

1. Navigate to the GitHub page for this project.
2. Locate the **Code** button and click it. Then, select **Download ZIP**.
3. Once the download is complete, extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.

## Preparing the Files

For the `script.py` to run correctly, you need to place specific files within the same folder as `script.py`. Here's a list of the files you'll need:

- `_ESTOQUE_ATUAL_LOJA.xlsx`
- `22.02.2024.csv`
- `ESTOQUE GERAL.xlsx`

If you haven't already, please ensure these files are downloaded and ready to be moved into the project folder.

## Running the Script

Once you have all the required files in the right place, you're ready to run the script. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the project and where `script.py` is located. You can do this by using the `cd` command followed by the path to the folder. For example:
```
cd path/to/folder
```
3. Run the script by typing the following command and pressing Enter:
```
python script.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, the script will execute and perform its intended tasks. Should you encounter any issues, please make sure all files are correctly placed in the folder and that you have Python properly installed on your computer.
